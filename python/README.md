# Bill Cobb's Vehicle Dynamics Professionals' Challenge - Python Solution

Solutions to Bill Cobb's Vehicle Dynamics Professional's challenge written in
Python by @kktse.

## Getting started

This project makes use of `pyenv` with virtual environments to manage Python
versions and package dependencies.

If you are using `pyenv`, install the specified version of Python in the
`.python-version` file.

```bash
# Check the specified python version
$ pyenv versions
3.12.1

# Install the specified python version
$ pyenv install
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it.

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open a notebook in your Jupyter editor of choice. Select the environment in
`venv` as the kernel.

Note that this step is trivial using the Visual Studio Code Jupyter extension.
Additional steps are required if you want to run the notebook in a browser
based Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab environment.
